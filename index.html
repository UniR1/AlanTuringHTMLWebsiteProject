        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23rd, the year 1912 to an upper-middle-class family. His family consisted of his mother, Ethel Sara Turing, his father, Julius Mathison Turing, and his elder brother, John Turing. At an early age, Alan Turing was at odds with the Imperialist authority at the time due to his scepticism and disrespect for current worldly values.
        </p>
        <p>Turing pursued higher studies as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge where he found his true home. There, he studied mathematics with great distinctions. Over the following decade, Alan Turing had made great strides in the field of computing. His first, and possibly greatest crowning achievement, being his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". What is said to have been the founding work of modern computer science</p>
        <p>During World War II from 1939 to 1945, he worked as a cryptologist breaking the German's Enigma code. In the process of this, he aided in the construction of the world's first supercomputer, the Colossus, which he used as the basis of in his original design of the ACE, the first modern electric computer, soon after.</p>
        <p>Perhaps he could have made further contributions were it not for his own untimely death on June 7th, 1954. He was dead at the age of 41 by his housekeeper. Investigations into his cause of death was concluded as suicide by cyanide poisoning; evidenced by the half-eaten apple found beside his bed. He was believed to have been pushed to this due to pressing charges of indecency due to his homosexual nature by the government at the time. He was pardoned posthumously from those charges, and Turing's ashes were scattered in the gardens of Woking Crematorium.</p>
