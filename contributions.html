      <p>1936: "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" and the Universal Turing Machine</p>

        <ul>
          <li>"On Computable Numbers" explored an essential idea to modern computers. Controlling its operations through means of coded instructions.</li>
          <li>The Turing Machine was an abstract concept based on that idea. It consisted of a scanner and a limitless memory tape. Using its small set of basic operations, it can print a symbol or even "remember" it. Even programmed to perform mathematical calculations</li>
          <li>As it could theoretically be programmed to carry out calculations and set procedures, it could perform at a similar capacity as a Human-computer, which were used by business, government, and research establishments in the thousands at the time. Much like how a cash register can count the total cost of someone's groceries, or logging data about item X after each use.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>1945-1947: Turing helps design the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE)</p>

      <p>*Pilot ACE based off Turing's design of the original ACE</p>
      <ul>
        <li>On October 1st, 1945 Turing outlined the first reasonably complete and detailed of a stored-program computer; a computer that stores program instructions in accessible memory.</li>
        <li>This allowed premade programs to exist and be run on any computing machine that would be able to run the instructions after it is downloaded to it. Applications such as Word or even mobile games.</li>
        <li>Early commercially available computers, such as the English Electric DEUCE and American Bendix G-15, owe their existence to this work. This, by extension, also means that modern computers like PCs and smartphones also owe their existence to his work.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>1950: Turing addresses artificial intelligence in "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"</p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Turing_test_diagram.png" alt="Turing Test Diagram"></img>
      <p>*Machine and human testing a human reader to see if they can tell if one is a machine</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Turing proposed an experiment now coined as the Turing Test. Originally called the Imitation Game by Turing, is a test to see if a machine's ability to exhibit intelligence is equal to that of a human. Enough so to pass as one in a text-based conversation.</li>
        <li>A result of this test was Turing's idea to design the AI at the level of a child's mind instead of an adult's. This was so the AI could be "taught" like how a child would and learn.</li>
        <li>This ultimately results in today's modern-times advanced AI learning software. Such as how a browser or website would "remember" your previous activities and later recommend similar objects related to it. Perhaps even farther into the future how a robot could learn to do a job if "taught".</li>
